Food deserts are areas are areas with limited access to affordable and nutritious food. The Massachussetts Public Health 
Association has found that nearly 40% of Massachussetts residents live these areas of limited grocery access. For my 
project, I propose a neighborhood-by-neighborhood analysis of food availability in Boston.
I plan to analyze datasets containing the geographic coordinates of each area code and neighborhood within Boston's limits,
to better understand which parts of the city are most affected. I will use data from the Google Places API to create a dataset
of grocery stores within the city, and combine this search with Boston's database of active food licenses. In addition,
I will study the income disparities within different Boston zipcodes by analyzing Boston Government employee earnings, 
and averaging them for each zipcode. I will also examine a database of Housing and Urban Development Income Limits. These
additional data sources will aid in finding low-income areas within the city, which are disproportionately affected by food deserts.
