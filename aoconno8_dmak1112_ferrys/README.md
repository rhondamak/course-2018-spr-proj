# Project 3
## Justification
Going to an establishment that allows alcohol consumption on the premises can be fun, but getting home can be dangerous. Even if you are not driving, you can encounter difficulty getting to your destination by public transportation. In Project #1, we incorporated datasets including Boston streetlight data, MBTA stops, and alcohol licenses. We performed transformations to combine these datasets to take the preliminary steps towards uncovering the most well-lit walking routes from the location of an alcohol-serving location to a public transportation stop.

In Project #2, we take this idea a step further by performing optimization techniques to calculate routes from locations with alcohol licenses to MBTA stops. We added transformations to get all of the streetlights in the radius of each alcohol license and to calculate both the shortest paths and the safest paths from each alcohol license to its 3 closest MBTA stops. The safest path is the path that includes the node with the most streetlights in the radius. Then, we perform an optimization technique that scores all six of the paths based on a number of factors including route distance, number of streetlights, and variance of streetlights along the path. By finding the highest scored path, we hope to be able to provide civilians with routes to nearby MBTA stops that provide a reasonable combination of convenience and safety.

We also perform various statistical analyses to test two hypotheses and to check for correlation. From these statistical analyses, we are able to get valuable information about the distribution of streetlights. For example, we discovered that in general, the mean number of streetlights near MBTA stops is greater than the mean number of streetlights near locations with alcohol licenses, so our endpoints have more streetlights than our starting points. More details about our results can be found below in the statistical analyses section.

In Project #3, we provided a visualization of the optimal routes from every alcohol license to the MBTA stop chosen using the Python package folium. We also provided two visualizations, the first of which shows how the distances of each route vary as the score increases between the safest routes and the shortest routes (Figure 2), while the second tracks the same interaction for only the optimized routes (Figure 3). These visualizations were created using d3.

We provided a flask app to allow users to toggle between our three visualizations. To run our flask app, run `python app.py` in the `visualizations/app` folder and then go to localhost:5000. Our visualizations retrieve their data from json datasets uploaded to http://datamechanics.io/?prefix=aoconno8_dmak1112_ferrys/, so there is no need to run our entire algorithm to see our results!

## Datasets

* [Alcohol Licenses](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/all-section-12-alcohol-licenses)
* [Streetlight Locations](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/streetlight-locations)
* [MBTA Developer V3 API Portal](https://api-v3.mbta.com)
* [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) (Accessed via [OSMnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx))

## Transformations

* *getClosestMBTAStops* - Combines MBTA stops and alcohol licenses and determines which public transportation stops are geographically close to each location of an alcohol license. Currently limits to 3.
* *getStreetlightsInRadius* - Gets all of the streetlights near each alcohol license using the distance to the farthest "closest" MBTA stop as the radius.

## Optimizations

* *getShortestPath* - Gets the shortest path and the "safest" path from each alcohol license  to its 3 closest MBTA stops. The safest path is the path that includes the node with the most streetlights.
* *optimization* - Takes the 6 paths generated from each alcohol license and scores them based on variance of streetlights on the path, number of streetlights, and distance. The equations are as follows:
   * Shortest path score = .4v + .4n - .1d
   * Safest path score = .45v + .4n - .15d
   
   Where v = variance of streetlights on route, n = number of streetlights on route, and d = route distance.
   
   Since we know that the safest path is either longer or the same as the shortest path, we weigh the distance less on the safest path and the variance a bit more. We specifically weigh the distance of the safest path slightly less since we know that it is safer than the shortest path.

## Statistical Analyses

For our statistical analyses, we tested two hypotheses and checked for correlation.

The first hypothesis that we tested was to see if the mean number of streetlights at the starting node along the route from alcohol licenses to MBTA stops is greater than the mean number of streetlights at the ending node of the paths:
* HO: u(starting node) - u(ending node) > 0
* HA: u(starting node) - u(ending node) <= 0
* alpha = .01 (We reject the null hypothesis if p < alpha.)

Results: z = 5.70, p < .0001

With a p value of <.01, we are able to reject our null hypothesis and conclude that there is sufficient evidence at alpha = .01, so the mean number of streetlights at the ending node (MBTA stop) of a route is greater than or equal to the mean number of streetlights at the starting node (alcohol license).

The second hypothesis we tested was to see if the mean number of streetlights at the start and end nodes of a route was greater than the mean number of streetlights at all of the middle nodes in the route. 
* HO: u(start+end nodes) - u(middle nodes) > 0
* HA: u(start+end nodes) - u(middle nodes) <= 0
* alpha = .01

Results: z = -6.14, p = .9998

With a p value that is much greater than .01, we are unable to reject the null hypothesis, meaning that there is not sufficient evidence at alpha = .01, so the mean number of streetlights at the starting and ending nodes in a route is greater than the mean number of streetlights at all middle nodes in the route.

Additionally, we ran three tests to check for correlation:
1. Number of streetlights at starting node vs ending node, r = .2007
2. Number of streetlights at ending nodes vs middle nodes, r = .4792
3. Number of nodes in a route vs total distance of route, r = .1683

All three tests for correlation did not yield convincing results, so none of these tests show strong correlation between the factors.

Finally, we determined the average number of nodes in a route and the average distance of a route. We found that the average number of nodes was 3.9375, and the average distance was 525.008 meters.


## Trial Method

To provide a quick way to test our transformations, we provide a trial method that runs our algorithms on a subset of the data. Our trial method takes approximately 20 seconds to complete. It runs through the entire algorithm with a pre-picked coordinate of an alcohol license location and 3 pre-picked MBTA stop coordinates. It does not run through the statistical analysis since the trial algorithm only outputs one route, but we append the hard-coded results of the statistical analysis on the entire collection of optimized routes instead.
