We have used the following five datasets to examine different restaurants and businesses:
Code Enforcement - Building and Property Violations (Analyze Boston), FOOD ESTABLISHMENT INSPECTIONS (Analyze Boston), Yelp Fusion, Boston Restaurant Licenses (Analyze Boston), NYC Health Inspection (NYC Open Data), and NYC Restaurant Licenses (NYC Open Data)

We used the Yelp Fusion api to obtain ratings for each restaurant in the Boston Restaurant Licenses dataset. 
We calculated the number of health and property violations for each restaurant in the Yelp dataset.
The average severity of the ratings were also taken into account.
The NYC Health Inspection data was compared against the NYC Restaurant License data to attribute health inspections to restaurants based on address and inspection date. The number of health violations and average score was also recorded.

The fundamental question we could look to answer is: Are businesses affected by health code and property violations, and if so, to what degree?
To solve this question, one could compare average ratings for a business based on their number and severity of violations.
The correlation could be compared between NYC and Boston to see if both sets of consumers act in similar manners. To complete this study, we would need to get Yelp ratings for NYC restaurants, and building code violations. Also, more rating systems, such as Google's and Foursquare's could help determine an average rating, rather than just relying on Yelp.
