# Project

## Description
This project is a work-in-progress port of two former Data Mechanics projects ([one](https://github.com/Data-Mechanics/course-2017-fal-proj/tree/master/nathansw_rooday_sbajwa_shreyap), [two](https://github.com/Data-Mechanics/course-2017-fal-proj/tree/master/nathansw_sbajwa)) from MapReduce/MongoDB to Spark/HDFS. It will eventually provide tools to easily import data from CKAN into Spark, and connect the SCC's Spark cluster to the web.
