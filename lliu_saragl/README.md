Every year when winter comes around, the buildup of snow makes every method of transportation more difficult. By pulling information from Boston's 311 request hotline, the amount of frustration can be seen when snow is in the way of going anywhere around Boston. Compiling snow violations, emergency routes for snow packed days, parking locations, city ratings, and our 311 requests, we can see the effect of the weather on the entire city.

Matching the zip-codes of requests corresponding to snow related issues and the zip codes of snow violations, we can map out the areas of Boston that require more assistance during the colder months. Especially when those areas are suburban, with many residents having nowhere else but the street to park their cars. Around there, salting and plowing becomes a major issue.

By mapping out emergency routes and parking garages, we can possibly work to make commutes and lives easier for Boston residents while also making sure that the streets remain clear.
